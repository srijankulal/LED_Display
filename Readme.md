### Custom 7-Segment Display with LEDs:

In this project, we will create our own 7-segment display using individual LED bulbs. This involves arranging the LEDs in the shape of a 7-segment display and controlling them with an Arduino.

### Steps to Create the Display:

1. **Arrange the LEDs**: Place 7 LEDs in the shape of a 7-segment display. Label each LED segment from 'a' to 'g'.
2. **Connect the LEDs**: Connect each LED to the corresponding Arduino pin as defined in the code. Use resistors if necessary to limit the current.
3. **Upload the Code**: Use the provided Arduino sketch to control the LEDs and display digits.

### Example LED Segment Connections:

- Segment 'a' -> Pin 10
- Segment 'b' -> Pin 1
- Segment 'c' -> Pin 2
- Segment 'd' -> Pin 3
- Segment 'e' -> Pin 4
- Segment 'f' -> Pin 5
- Segment 'g' -> Pin 6

This setup allows you to create a custom 7-segment display using individual LEDs, which can be controlled using the provided Arduino code and `LED_Display` library.
